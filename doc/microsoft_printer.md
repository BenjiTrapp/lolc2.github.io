##### Abusing Microsoft Printer for C2
Attackers can exploit Microsoft Windows' Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to establish a covert command and control (C2) channel. By leveraging shared printers, commands are encoded in document names within the print queue, which infected clients can retrieve and execute. This technique bypasses traditional security controls, requires no administrative privileges for printer addition, and allows data exfiltration via printed documents.
