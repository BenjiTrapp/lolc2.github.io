### **Abusing WhatsApp for C2**  

Attackers can exploit WhatsApp’s XMPP-based messaging protocol and media transfer APIs to create a covert command-and-control (C2) channel, enabling bi-directional communication with infected devices. This allows adversaries to send remote commands, receive execution results, and exfiltrate stolen data, all while camouflaging malicious traffic as normal WhatsApp activity. By automating interactions through unofficial APIs like **Yowsup** (used by the project whatsappcli) or abusing WhatsApp Web library like whatsapp-web.js, attackers can establish a stealthy C2 framework that operates within encrypted message exchanges, making detection difficult. Commands can be embedded in incoming WhatsApp messages, instructing the execution tasks such as file exfiltration, keylogging, or persistence mechanisms, with execution results sent back via outbound messages or media transfers. Attackers can leverage WhatsApp’s media servers (mms.whatsapp.net) to exfiltrate sensitive data, disguising payloads as legitimate file-sharing activity.

#### **Additional samples in the wild**

##### FlixOnline

A modified version of the **FlixOnline** malware used WhatsApp as a remote command execution channel. Instead of simply spreading via auto-replies, this variant allowed attackers to send commands via **specific WhatsApp messages**, which the malware intercepted and executed. The malware had the capability to **download payloads, execute system commands, and respond back via WhatsApp messages**, effectively turning WhatsApp into an encrypted C2 channel.

##### South Asian Android RAT
A **South Asian Android RAT** was discovered using **WhatsApp messages to receive encoded commands**, extracted using regex patterns. This allowed attackers to **remotely control infected devices via WhatsApp**. The malware operated by monitoring incoming WhatsApp messages, executing commands if they matched predefined attacker-controlled patterns, and sending back execution results.
